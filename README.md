# Randomized-Optimization
Please note that to run any of the code files, Jython 2.7.0 is required.

Steps to run the code -

1. Enter the ABAGAIL folder

2. Open a Terminal, PowerShell, or other command line utility

3. Type "ant" 

4. After doing this individual Jython files can be run on the terminal/command line

5. To run a particular Jython file, type the following command on the terminal

	$ jython <filename.py> 

	Replace filename with the file you want to run



Folder structure - 

1) The three optimization problems are in three different folders, one for each problem (Continuous Peaks, Knapsack, Travelling Salesperson)

2) The implementation of the backdrop layer using the three algorithms is in the folder neural networks



To get the graphs -

1) I have used ipython notebooks to get the graphs
2) To get the graphs please open the subfolder for which you want the graph and run the respective ipython notebook
